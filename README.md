**ULimiter: Control Your Time on YouTube Shorts**

YouTube Shorts can be highly addictive, often leading to extended periods of unproductive screen time. **ULimiter** is a simple yet powerful Chrome extension designed to help you regain control over your viewing habits by reducing the time spent watching YouTube Shorts.

### Key Features:
- **Time Restriction**: Set custom limits on how long you can watch YouTube Shorts in a session or per day.
- **Block Excessive Usage**: Once the time limit is reached, ULimiter will block access to YouTube Shorts until the restriction is lifted or the next time window is available.
- **Customizable Settings**: Tailor the time limits to fit your needs. Whether it's restricting usage by setting a daily cap, the control is in your hands.
- **Seamless Integration**: The extension runs in the background, automatically detecting and limiting access to YouTube Shorts without interrupting other content on YouTube.

Take charge of your time and enjoy YouTube in a more mindful way with **ULimiter**.
